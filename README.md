# picture-poker-rs
A terminal based clone of Luigi's Picture Poker, written in Rust.

## Where's the code????
I don't have internet on my current machine so there's no way for me to upload the code until I have internet.

Until the code is a functional game the wip build will be on another branch. Master branch will be updated with major releases/fixes as needed.
